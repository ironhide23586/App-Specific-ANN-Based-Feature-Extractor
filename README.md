In a departmental store, a bar-code scanner is used at the billing
counter to log the commodities purchased by the customers and
generate bills. The process of finding the bar-code on the
commodity is often cumbersome for the cashier manning the billing
counter.

Moreover many a times, the bar-code on the commodity is
damaged or unreadable by the bar-code scanner causing the cashier
to manually enter the bar-code number into the system. All these
predicaments translate into loss of precious business time for the
corporations or individuals owning the stores. 

This application seeks
to speed up the billing process by replacing the bar-code scanner
with a camera. 

The commodity to be billed may be placed in any
orientation in front of the camera. The application will click a
snapshot of the same, analyse the image and subsequently add the
corresponding price of the commodity to the customerâ€™s bill.
